# JMerge
A simple Java Mapmerge tool for .dmm map files

# What does JMerge do?
JMerge has two functions:
1. Cleaning of map files after editing. If you edit files in BYOND's IDE, map files tend to change a lot. JMerge will attempt to minimize row changes, making it easier for multiple people to work on the map at the same time (as long as they don't touch the same areas)
2. Merging map files. This feature is currently still in development, but when finished it will allow you to automatically resolve git merge conflicts in map files.
